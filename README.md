## Problem Statement

Online assessment platforms often store multi-branch student responses in a single spreadsheet, forcing faculty to manually filter data, verify attendance, and perform repetitive analysis. This leads to delays, human errors, and inefficient academic monitoring.

AutoEval AI automates this entire workflow, delivering faster insights, accurate attendance detection, and structured academic analytics.
